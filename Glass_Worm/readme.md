# Glass Worm
*by Batist in 2006 from the black notebook with the read corners*

## Ultimate Goal

To provide large deserts with pipelines at extremely low cost. These pipelines could transport water (possibly seawater) far into the dessert.

## How it works
* It uses sand as base material.
* It melts the sand and fuses it together into tubes.
* It uses solare energy. (perhaps fresnell lenses)
