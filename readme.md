# Welcome to AntoBase Labs

This website contains some raw ideas, sketches and prototypes. They used to be scribbled down in tucked away notebooks, never to be opened again. By posting them here I'm setting them free.


If you want to contact me about anything you can:
* email me: batist.leman@gmail.com
* fork this website on GitHub: https://github.com/AntoBase/antobase.github.io
* submit an issue on something: https://github.com/AntoBase/antobase.github.io/issues
 
Have fun and chillax,  
Batist
